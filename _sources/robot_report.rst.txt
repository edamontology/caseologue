ROBOT report 
=============

General quality control for ontology is run on EDAM using the ROBOT `report command <http://robot.obolibrary.org/report>`_. 
This tool calls a customizable list of `SPARQL queries <http://robot.obolibrary.org/report_queries/>`_. 
Some of these queries were modified to fit the EDAM properties.
