# caseologue

**caseologue** is a set of tools used to ensure the consistency, coherence and stability of the EDAM ontology and its extensions.

caseologue controls use the [ROBOT](http://robot.obolibrary.org/) tool, running both standard and custom queries, as well as a custom python package. All these controls are implemented and usable as GitHub Actions. Detailed documentation is available [here](https://edamontology.github.io/caseologue/).
