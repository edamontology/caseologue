# edam-validation

edam-validation is a set of tools used to ensure the consistency, coherence ans stability of the EDAM ontology. \
Both rOBOt and caseologue are implemented in GitHub Actions in both this repository and the main edamontology repository. This continuous integration (CI) pipeline is triggered triggered by push and Pull Requests.\
edam-validation can also be used for curation purposes.


Note: caseologue used to be named edamci and then edam-custom, there might be some leftover in the code or some branches
